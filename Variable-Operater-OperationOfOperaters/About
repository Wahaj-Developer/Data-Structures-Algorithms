#JavaScript Variables: `var`, `let`, `const`

## Key Concepts

- **Variable:** A named container for storing data.  
  Example: `let score = 10;`

- **Operator:** A symbol that performs an operation on values.  
  Examples: `+`, `-`, `=`, `*`, `/`

- **Operation of Operator:** The action performed by the operator.  
  Example: `5 + 2` performs addition, resulting in `7`.

## Variable Declaration Examples

### 1. Correct Usage

```javascript
var a = 12;
console.log(a); // Output: 12
```

---

### 2. Hoisting Behavior

```javascript
// This works but is confusing (with var)
console.log(a); // Output: undefined
var a;

// This causes a clear error (with let) - PREFERRED
console.log(b); // Error: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 12;
```

---

### 3. Undefined vs. Not Defined

```javascript
console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined (variable never exists)

console.log(y); // Output: undefined (variable exists but has no value)
var y;
```

## Why use `let`/`const` over `var`?

- **Block Scope:**  
  `let` and `const` are confined to `{}` blocks, making code safer and more predictable.

- **No Hoisting Issues:**  
  They prevent access before declaration, throwing a clear error instead of returning `undefined`.

- **No Re-declaration:**  
  You cannot accidentally declare the same variable twice, which helps prevent bugs.

**Best Practice:**  
Prefer `const` (for variables that never change), otherwise use `let`.  
Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript.
